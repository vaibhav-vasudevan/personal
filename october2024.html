    <h1>am i a killer?</h1>
    <h3>october 2024</h3>

    <p>The Dirlewanger Brigade, led by convicted criminal Oskar Dirlewanger, was an infamous Nazi SS unit in German-occupied Eastern Europe. Formed to combat resistance fighters, its ranks swelled with the vilest convicts, committing atrocities so horrific they sickened even hardened Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS troops. One story that has always haunted me is the moment they invaded a makeshift hospital. There, they slaughtered the wounded and tortured the Red Cross nurses, ultimately hanging them by their feet and shooting them. Reading this, I felt a deep sickness—not just at the horrors themselves but at what they reveal about human nature.</p>

    <p class="emphasized-question">Could I, under different circumstances, become capable of similar acts?</p>

    <p>Ask these men a few years earlier if they could ever take part in such atrocities, and the answer would almost certainly have been “no.” These were people with families, neighbors, routines, emotions. Yet under the grip of authoritarian rule, propaganda, and the pressure to conform, they became complicit in unthinkable horrors.</p>

    <p>This is a truth I’d rather ignore: morality isn’t a fortress but a thin membrane, easily torn. Fear, obedience, and the primal need to belong—these forces can dissolve the values we think define us. It’s comforting to imagine a clear line dividing “good” from “evil,” yet history warns us that line blurs all too easily. The capacity for horror lies in each of us, hidden beneath layers we rarely peel back.</p>

    <p>Those men didn’t wake up as killers; they were shaped, bit by bit, into instruments of harm by forces beyond themselves. And that is what terrifies me the most: realizing that, under the right conditions, I could justify the unthinkable.</p>

    <p>Hannah Arendt called it “the banality of evil”—how people, through routine, obedience, and a sense of duty, slip into complicity until they’re no longer acting on their own moral compass. Under the weight of conformity, the men of the Brigade surrendered their judgment, letting the group strip away their humanity.</p>

    <p class="emphasized-question">But would I really resist?</p>

    <p>The honest answer? I don’t know. I tell myself I’d be one of the “good ones,” that I’d take a stand, but is that true? How often have I stayed silent, let things slide, gone along to avoid conflict? Small moments, yes, but if I’m already willing to compromise to keep the peace, what would I do under true pressure? History tells us that, faced with fear or isolation, most people follow, justifying their actions as part of some “greater good” until they’ve crossed a line they can’t even see.</p>

    <p>The men of the Dirlewanger Brigade weren’t born murderers; they were shaped, bit by bit, until they no longer recognized themselves. And I wonder—if I were in their place, would I be any different?</p>

    <p>The real horror isn’t just what they did; it’s knowing that the same darkness exists in me. I want to believe I’d resist, that I’d choose a side I could live with, but would I? Or would I, like them, slip silently into obedience, until one day, I look in the mirror and see a stranger—someone capable of the things I swore I’d never do?</p>

    <p>That’s the worst part: the line we fear isn’t outside us. It’s right here, inside, blurring and bending. And whhen the time comes, I don’t know which side of it I’d be on.</p>
